# K-Nearest-Neighbour
## K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm for Machine Learning

- K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique.
- K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
- K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
- K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.

### How does K-NN work?
 The K-NN working can be explained on the basis of the below algorithm:

- Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors
- Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors
- Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
- Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.
- Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
- Step-6: Our model is ready.
